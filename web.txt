The internet works based off a series of networks, which is a whole bunch of computers having a method to communicate with one another. The internet works like a train station,
the people or information loads onto a transportation method to get to a different location, similarly how computers are sending info to one another. You are essentially telling your
local machine to talk to a server machine anywhere in the world to request information that the server should provide.

When you click on a link, your machine send the request to the server. the server will then receive the request and begin processing the request. Once the server has completed the 
requested action, the server will then process this info to send back to the original machine that submitted the request. The request has then been processed and the servers response
to your request will be displayed on your browser.
